# Commission status: <span style="color:red">**Closed**</span>

This repository contains my commission informations and prices, example pieces, 
as well as personal and commission artwork that clients authorized to be public.

## General information
My commissions are currently <span style="color:red">closed</span>; I will announce
on social media and on here an ETA on opening when it happens. I reserve the rights
to refuse commissions to anyone I deem inappropriate (see [my drawing conditions](#What-I-will-and-will-NOT-draw)).

## Commission queue
*My commission queue will be displayed here when I am open.*

## What I will and will NOT draw
I reserve the rights to refuse to draw certain topics, species or kinks if they make
me uncomfortable or if they are racist, LGBTQIA+ phobic, or any other prejudice
against a group of people based on their religion, race, sexual orientation, gender,
social status, ...

### NSFW Content
In general, *I will not take NSFW commissions unless it was made explicit I do so*.
I will announce that I take NSFW commissions; otherwise, NSFW commissions will be
refused.

NSFW content is content that is sexual or suggestive in nature, or containing kinks
of any kind, even not inherently sexual.

Even for NSFW commissions, I will not accept commissions for the following kinks and subjects:
- Scatophilia of any kind
- Babyfur
- Pregnancy of any kind (ask for oviposition)
- Transformation into objects and/or vehicles
- Sentient objects and/or vehicles
- Nazi memorabilia and/or outfits
- Anything cop or military related (K9, soldiers, ...)
- Non-consensual situations
- Underage characters

This list is **NOT** exhaustive; please, in any case, ask beforehand if you wish to commission me for kinks.

## Price information and payment options
The following prices are indicative and non-negotiable. Tips are appreciated, but optional. The prices are calculated in accordance to [France's minimum wage for Growth (SMIC)](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F2300?lang=en),
which is currently €10.15/h. Additional fees may be required for *extensive* rework (see below), additional characters and/or props.

If my commissions are closed, the prices indicated below are reflective of the last
period of time my commissions were open; they may **not** reflect the prices for the next time my commissions are opened.

| Type of commission       | Price         |
| ------------------------ |--------------:|
| Profile pictures & icons | €20           | 
| Busts                    | €30           | 
| Full-body                | €50           |
| Additional character     | +€15          |
| Detailed background      | +€15          |

Modifications are welcomed! Do not hesitate to tell me if something is wrong and
needs to be adjusted. Please, do not abuse it though. I *will* charge clients an 
additionnal fee of €5 for extensive modifications, i.e. modifying the body anatomy
in the colouring phase. Please, make sure that everything is correct before giving
me approval to continue onwards as I send you WIPs!

I only accept payments through **Paypal**, using my [professional Paypal account](https://paypal.me/shadyfennec). Payment is made **up-front**. When cancelling the
commission:
- If no work has been made, I will refund the price in full.
- If the work has been partially completed, I will refund 80% of the price of the
  commission.
- If the work has been fully completed, I will not refund the commission.

## Commission phases
After payment has been made, you will be added to the [commission queue](##Commission-queue). 
I will message you when you reach the front, and begin working on your commission.
I will then send you *work-in-progress* pictures at each phase of the work:

- Rough sketch
- Refined sketch
- Inked piece
- Flat color
- Shading & details

Those work-in-progress pictures are necessary for you to tell me if I need to change 
anything *regarding the current phase*. Please be accurate: I would rather not have 
to change something that is relevant to a previous phase (for example, adjusting the 
pose during the flat colouring phase). I welcome any changes or suggestions, as long 
as they are reasonable!
